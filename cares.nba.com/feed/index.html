<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>– Adebayo Recognized for Hosting Annual Toy Drive and Creating Unforgettable Experiences for Youth –&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p><strong>NEW YORK,</strong> Jan. 21, 2026 – The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) today announced Miami Heat center-forward Bam Adebayo as the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award winner for December.&nbsp; Adebayo is being recognized for his leadership in hosting his annual holiday toy drive and creating unforgettable experiences for underserved youth through his foundation.&nbsp; The NBA and the NBPA Foundation will donate $20,000 to the Edrice Adebayo Foundation in honor of his efforts.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>In December, Adebayo welcomed nearly 2,300 students from underserved communities to the Kaseya Center for his annual toy drive.&nbsp; Children enjoyed a holiday meal before participating in a game-style toy grab on the court, where they collected toys to take home.&nbsp; In total, more than 36,000 toys were distributed, with remaining gifts donated to local organizations across South Florida.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>Adebayo also created unforgettable experiences for youth beyond Miami.&nbsp; He flew in eight student-athletes from his hometown (Greensboro, NC) and their chaperones for an exclusive game-day weekend, rewarding their hard work and academic achievement.&nbsp; The trip included a cooking class, a panel with Heat players, a boat ride, and a courtside game complete with jerseys and a meet-and-greet with Adebayo.&nbsp; Additionally, his foundation surprised fans in arena with seat upgrades, reinforcing its mission to spread joy in meaningful ways.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>Further demonstrating his commitment, Adebayo organized a special outreach for five student-athletes facing significant hardships, flying them to Miami for a Heat game where they were recognized by Head Coach Erik Spoelstra and met with Heat President and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Pat Riley about what it takes to be successful.&nbsp; Each student received a Bam Care Package that included Air Jordan 1 Retros, full uniform outfits, and essential items.&nbsp; The experience inspired future aspirations, with several students expressing interest in careers in sports and media following the trip.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>“To me, the holidays have always been a special time of year that inspires us to give back and serve others,” said Adebayo.&nbsp; “It’s about spreading kindness during a season that can be difficult for a lot of people. We go big in December, but the mission of my foundation is bigger than one moment on the calendar — it’s about showing up, putting in the work, and making an impact year-round.”</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>The NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award honors NBA legend and Hall of Famer Bob Lanier, an NBA League Office executive and NBA Cares Ambassador for more than 30 years.&nbsp; He had an enormous influence on the NBA family and young people globally, traveling the world to teach the values of the game and making a positive impact through his kindness and generosity.&nbsp; The legacy he built will continue to live on through the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award, which recognizes the next generation of players’ commitment to positively impacting their communities throughout the NBA season.&nbsp; Each NBA season has an offseason winner followed by seven monthly award winners.&nbsp; The offseason winner receives the Bob Lanier trophy, and each monthly winner receives the David Robinson trophy.&nbsp; The NBA and the NBPA Foundation also make a donation to the charity or foundation of the player’s choice.&nbsp; To learn more, please visit <a href="https://cares.nba.com/programs/nba-cares-community-assist-award/">communityassist.nba.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NEW YORK,</strong> Dec. 17, 2025 – The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) today announced Los Angeles Lakers center Deandre Ayton as the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award winner for November.&nbsp; Ayton is being recognized for his leadership in spearheading hurricane relief efforts in Jamaica and creating programs that promote food access and cultural equity among underrepresented youth in Los Angeles.&nbsp; The NBA and the NBPA Foundation will donate $20,000 to the Ayton Family Foundation (AFF) in recognition of his efforts.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>In July, Ayton and AFF reopened the Cedar Spring Community Center in St. Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica – his mother’s hometown – transforming it into a hub for education, health, and recreation.&nbsp; To celebrate, Ayton hosted a community day for more than 100 children and families, providing free medical and dental screenings, school supplies, sneakers, and a full community meal.&nbsp; The refurbished center now serves as a safe space for youth programming, mentorship and family engagement.&nbsp; Following Hurricane Melissa, Ayton mobilized an immediate relief plan, committing $100,000 to rebuilding efforts and activating the Cedar Spring Community Center as an emergency shelter and distribution hub.&nbsp; AFF coordinated shipments of food and essential goods and is funding new zinc roofs for 30 families and pledged funds for long-term rebuilding in 2026.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>In Los Angeles, Ayton launched the Ayton Alley Oop Program, donating tickets to Lakers games and other sporting events for youth from underrepresented communities.&nbsp; Through collaborations with organizations like the Boys &amp; Girls Club, Salvation Army, and SüprMarkt LA, AFF is advancing food justice and cultural inclusion.&nbsp; Ayton has also committed $25,000 to support SüprMarkt LA’s SNAP BACK initiative, which provides fresh produce and healthy meals to families in need.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>“My family taught me that feeding people is love, and that’s exactly what the Foundation represents,” said Ayton.&nbsp; “We honor our roots by giving back, creating access, and building a stronger future for the communities that made us who we are.”</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>Committed Resources to Important Issues Facing Chicago –&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p><strong>NEW YORK,</strong> Nov. 21, 2025 – The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) today announced Chicago Bulls guard Tre Jones as the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award winner for October.  Jones is being recognized for helping raise more than $1.1 million towards cancer research and awareness, and for supporting violence prevention and local businesses in Chicago.  The NBA and the NBPA Foundation will donate $20,000 to The V Foundation for Cancer Research (Jimmy V Foundation) in recognition of Jones’ efforts.  Jones is the fourth Chicago Bull to receive this award since 2023.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>In September, Jones co-hosted the 2025 Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research Chicago Epicurean gala and auction that raised $1.13 million towards advancing cancer research, an issue that is especially important to Jones.&nbsp; Jones’ mother, Debbie, is a breast cancer survivor, and Jones has consistently used his platform to raise awareness of the disease.&nbsp; During the gala, the Jimmy V Foundation announced a research grant in honor of Debbie Jones, with funds supporting research by the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center to improve immunotherapy options for cancer patients.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>For the third consecutive year, Jones participated in the Susan G. Komen VIPink campaign during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.&nbsp; The Susan G. Komen Foundation strives to save lives and meet community needs by investing in breakthrough breast cancer research.&nbsp; In support of the VIPink campaign, Jones encouraged people to donate to breast cancer research and treatment, and he distributed pink wristbands to Bulls players and staff in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>In addition to championing cancer research and awareness, Jones is active in Chicago through his support of violence prevention, local business development and climate change activism.&nbsp; He partnered with the Obama Foundation’s Brotherhood Rising Program, which builds safe and supportive communities for young men and boys in Chicago.&nbsp; As an incentive, Jones will invite all who finish the six-week program to a Bulls game, including an exclusive meet-and-greet courtside before the game.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>Jones also participated in the sixth year of the Bulls and BMO’s <a href="https://www.nba.com/bulls/community/business-spotlight">Spotlight Business Program</a>, which uplifts and spotlights small businesses in Chicago, providing them with meaningful opportunities to reach their full potential.&nbsp; He contributed by visiting <a href="https://www.nba.com/bulls/community/business-spotlight">Lovely Intentions</a> – one of five Chicago small businesses selected as part of this year’s cohort – and sat with the owners to discuss their inspiration, mission and how Bulls fans can learn more about their business.&nbsp; His visit to Lovely Intentions will be chronicled in December across Bulls social media platforms.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>Jones has also been an advocate for Adapt2win, a global campaign calling on COP30 leaders to invest in climate adaptation.&nbsp; He joined fellow professional athletes from around the world in this new endeavor, aiming to mount the “largest comeback of all time” off the court by shifting financial investments to solutions that help communities withstand extreme weather and climate events.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p><a>“I’m grateful for the chance</a> to use my voice to advocate for important causes like cancer research, climate adaptation and local business development,” said Jones.  “I look forward to continuing this work to raise awareness, provide resources, and help those in need in Chicago and beyond.”</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>Jones serves on the board of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition, which leads the NBA family’s efforts to advance bipartisan social justice policy promoting community safety, criminal justice reform, policing reform, and voting rights.  Jones is also a contributor to The Power of Basketball: NBA Players, Coaches, and Team Governors on the Fight to Make a Better America—a book of essays written by leaders across the NBA and WNBA committed to social justice.</p>

<p><a></a><a></a><strong>NEW YORK,</strong> October 30, 2025 – The NBA and the NBPA today announced Oklahoma City Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein as the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award winner for the 2025 offseason.&nbsp; Hartenstein and his foundation (Hartenstein Foundation) collaborated with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Oklahoma County and Positive Tomorrows to provide a shopping spree for students and built a community basketball court.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>Shortly after becoming an NBA champion in June, Hartenstein donated $10,000 to Positive Tomorrows—an organization that partners with families experiencing homelessness to educate their children and create pathways to success.&nbsp; Hartenstein followed that donation in September with an additional $12,000 to provide back-to-school supplies and essentials for students getting ready to start the school year.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>As part of his efforts with the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Oklahoma County, Hartenstein unveiled a newly built basketball court at the Northeast Boys and Girls Club – gifted and dedicated by the Hartenstein Foundation.&nbsp; Hartenstein also provided a shopping experience for kids from the club to purchase back-to-school essentials and clothes.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>During the summer, Hartenstein returned home to Germany to host the iHart festival from Aug. 6-12.&nbsp; Festivities included a 3v3 basketball tournament, slam dunk contest, music, food and a kid’s playground.</p>
</span>

<span class="wp-block-paragraph">
<p>“Winning the award means a lot and being recognized for something like this is really special,” said Hartenstein.&nbsp; “At the end of the day, you don&#8217;t do it for awards, you really do it to give back to the community and change people&#8217;s lives.”</p>
